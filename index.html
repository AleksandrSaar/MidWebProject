                <h2>Who is Joji?.. and why is he so ducking cool?</h2>
                <p>
                    George Kusunoki Miller, better known by his stage name Joji and formerly by his online aliases Filthy Frank and Pink Guy, is a Japanese singer, songwriter, comedian, and a former Internet personality and YouTuber.<p>I have known him since the beginning of his YouTube career, it was sad to see him stop doing Filthy Frank, but later gotten word that he is still online (Online meaning that he’s back!). My friend sent me a link to a YouTube video, I looked at the title “joji - will he ”. I’m thinking to myself, “Could it be him?”, sure enough his face shows up! From that day on, I have fallen in love with his music, I don’t know if it is for you but him and his music was so captivating. I never let a day go by without listening to his music.I have read a lot of his tweets and in the comments, people say the same thing. But I personally think it helps me with anxiety, to me it feels relatable in his songs. But that’s just how Joji is great.
